A library of useful code for building educational games with Love2D, and game implementations


Outline
-------

libs/
	A directory of all the game engines

games/
	A collection of games implemented using the game engines


Preparing Games for Use
-----------------------

[build-dir] - directory we're building the games in
[game] - the name of the game we're building

Linux/OS X
~~~~~~~~~~

mkdir [build-dir]
cp -r games/[game] [build-dir]
cp -r libs/* [build-dir]/[game]
cd [build-dir]/[game]
zip -r ../${PWD##*/}.love * 

This leaves [game].love in the [build-dir]
